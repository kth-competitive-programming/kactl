 * Description: Topological sorting. Given is an oriented graph.
 * Output is an ordering of vertices, such that there are edges only from left to right.
 * If there are cycles, the returned list will have size smaller than $n$ -- nodes reachable
 * from cycles will not be returned.
 * Time: $O(|V|+|E|)$
 * Status: stress-tested
